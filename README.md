## description
- ever feel lazy and incomplete while writing code! or maybe have a problem choosing correct ML algorithm for your data. this is where Lumin comes in.

## requirements
make sure you have all these
```
tqdm==4.47.0
pandas==1.0.5
plotly==4.12.0
matplotlib==3.2.2
numpy==1.19.3
seaborn==0.10.1
streamlit==0.75.0
xgboost==1.2.1
```

## usage
- datatset is uploaded after runing the script!
```
streamlit run optima.py
```
as of now, only two functionalities exist 
 - classification 
 - regression
I plan on adding more in future.

## working
- refer to this yee-yee flowchart for an idea

## TO-DO
- [ ] make script more elegant
- [x] host it somewhere
- [ ] add more functionality (neural networks maybe!)
